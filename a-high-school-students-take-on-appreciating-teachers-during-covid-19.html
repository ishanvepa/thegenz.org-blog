Our teachers, like front line workers across the nation, are selflessly doing their job, so that we, as students, can be better prepared for challenges that are yet to come.</p><p><br>During this crisis, lesson plans have gone awry, and teachers have had to adapt to virtual teaching platforms often at very short notice, overcoming hurdles that would have seemed insurmountable a few months ago. Across the country, teachers have responded with remarkable alacrity and resolve; they are following up with us, ensuring that we stay safe, and have offered us their thoughts and personal cell numbers to reach out to.<br>As a student attending a Title I school, I know that many of my peers are struggling to access digital resources. Yet, undaunted by this digital divide, my teachers are going out of their way to print out packets and are often personally delivering them to their students. Our teachers did not sign up to serve as human shields during school shootings, but they did that. Our teachers did not sign up to teach in the middle of a global pandemic, yet they are doing just that. Their strength of character, and willingness to help us under all circumstances is visible and tangible in our lives.<br>Despite this, we students complain about mundane things. Even now, I noticed how my peers and I were whining about extra credit opportunities. In retrospect, I can realize how petty that is. We simply cannot take our teachers for granted. Sometimes we forget the time a teacher helped us out when we faced a stressful situation, or when they stayed after school, just to make sure that we understood a concept. Sure, we can recognize our teachers for the hard work they are doing in a specific week meant for “teacher appreciation,” but let us resolve to appreciate our teachers regardless of the time. When we get back to school, let us remember how our teachers scheduled individual calls with us to make sure that we were alright. Let us remember how our teachers had to discard lesson plans that they made months in advance and become proficient in software applications that they would have rarely used otherwise.<br>Next time, when you are turning in your assignment, type a small thank you note for your teacher, or ask them if they are doing well. Our teachers do everything for us but ask for little in return. They could have been anything they wanted to, yet they chose to be teachers, so that they could help us achieve our dreams. Our teachers have invested more in the future of our country, than any hedge fund, or investment bank. The least we students can do… is to appreciate them.</p><p> </p></div><aside class="post__aside"><div class="post__last-updated u-small">This article was updated on June 1, 2020</div><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.thegenz.org%2Fa-high-school-students-take-on-appreciating-teachers-during-covid-19.html" class="js-share facebook" title="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Facebook"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.thegenz.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.thegenz.org%2Fa-high-school-students-take-on-appreciating-teachers-during-covid-19.html&amp;via=thegenzorg&amp;text=A%20High%20School%20Student's%20Take%20on%20Appreciating%20Teachers%20During%20COVID-19" class="js-share twitter" title="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with Twitter"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.thegenz.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.thegenz.org%2Fa-high-school-students-take-on-appreciating-teachers-during-covid-19.html&amp;title=A%20High%20School%20Student's%20Take%20on%20Appreciating%20Teachers%20During%20COVID-19" class="js-share linkedin" title="Share with LinkedIn" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" aria-label="Share with LinkedIn"><svg class="u-icon"><use xlink:href="https://blog.thegenz.org/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg></a></div></aside><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__bio box"><img class="u-author__avatar" src="https://blog.thegenz.org/media/website/Ananda-smiling-pic.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Ananda Chatterjee"><div><h4 class="h6"><a href="https://blog.thegenz.org/authors/ananda-chatt/" title="Ananda Chatterjee">Ananda Chatterjee</a></h4><p>Executive Director</p></div></div><nav class="post__nav box"><div class="post__nav__next"><a href="https://blog.thegenz.org/remembering-the-selma-voting-rights-movement.html" class="post__nav__link" rel="next"><div class="u-small">Next Post<h5>Remembering the Selma Voting Rights Movement</h5></div><img src="https://blog.thegenz.org/media/posts/8/responsive/SelmaMonteMarch1-xs.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Photo depicting a Selma-to-Montgomery March memorial."></a></div></nav></footer></article><div class="comments box"><h3 class="box__title">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
