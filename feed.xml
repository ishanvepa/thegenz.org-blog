<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  Activists want CT to declare racism a public health crisis because systemic racism in CT needs drastic measures to be addressed and changed. Plus, racism also causes health issues for minorities such as black people. In addition, systemic racism in CT has caused black people to have less access to health care. By making a public health crisis declaration pertaining to racism, people will see how big of an issue it really is, and it will shed light on the racism that still exists in CT. The declaration will also bring more attention to the issue, allowing for more possible reforms and changes in the right direction.</span></p>

<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The COVID-19 pandemic has brought Connecticut’s racial inequities into sharp focus. Black residents here are 2 ½ times more likely to die from a coronavirus infection than whites.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“People of color here are also more likely to work in high-risk, ‘essential’ jobs, such as those in nursing homes, grocery stores and retail, to live in densely populated communities, and to have higher rates of pre-existing conditions like diabetes and asthma that are caused or worsened by systemic racism.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“During the pandemic, residents in low income, predominantly minority neighborhoods have faced larger barriers to testing and other services. Until May, two-thirds of the state’s testing sites required a doctor’s note, and many people living in these communities have no insurance or primary care doctor to refer them.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“A study by the Connecticut Health Foundation in January highlighted links between discrimination and ‘negative physical and mental health consequences’ including depression, anxiety, hypertension, breast cancer, and giving birth preterm or having a low-birthweight baby. ‘Research suggests that one way discrimination could lead to poorer health is through repeated activation of the body’s stress response system, which can have negative long-term physiological and psychological effects,’ the foundation noted.”</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Article Title</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “<strong>Racism in Connecticut’s education system must be exposed and corrected</strong>”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Anita Samuels from the CT Mirror</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: There is still a lot of systemic racism in CT’s education system. Most of the educators making decisions about hiring other educators, and promoting other educators, are white. Black educators have to work harder than white educators in order to get hired or be recognized for a promotion. “Black educators in Connecticut, with the appropriate credentials, have found job attainment difficult in any district.” Connecticut’s attempts to increase minority teachers and school staff have failed. Black people often get interviews, but are not hired. There should not be a qualified black educator that is jobless. How are we supposed to get black people to go into education, when there’s a large possibility they may get rejected? There should be systematic monitoring of districts to see how many minority educators apply, how many are interviewed, how many are hired and how many are promoted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Quotes From the Article</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The majority of educators, approximately 90%, making decisions on who gets hired, promoted in a district and even at the state level, are white.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The study found that all black participants (certified educators) experienced and perceived unconscious bias and racial discrimination during the hiring process.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In fact, in 2019, some districts in Connecticut had no minorities on staff; affluent districts employ few educators of color or none at all.For example, among Greenwich district’s 978 teachers, 2% were black; Darien district had 1% among 544; Westport and Wilton had fewer than 1%; and Weston district had none.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“According to the State’s Diversifying the Educator Workforce office, between 2013 and 2017, 739 qualified minority educators had not attained positions in Connecticut’s education system; approximately 300 black, and 350 Hispanic...According to Connecticut’s Department of Labor Statistics, there were approximately 651 teacher positions available, yearly, between 2013 and 2017; a total of 2,604. Not hiring 300 black educators total in that same time span is not acceptable.”</span></li>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Article Title</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “<strong>Whites-only rules still surface in CT property records</strong>”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Author</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Ken Dixon from the Middletown Press</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">: When a couple was going to buy a small cottage near a lake, their lawyer found this in the contract: “No portion of this said premises shall be conveyed or leased to any other than the Caucasian Race.” Whites only rules were common in neighborhoods or areas of CT, even after the US Supreme Court case, Shelley v. Kraemer, outlawed restrictive housing in 1948. There are other racially restrictive contracts found in historic property documents throughout CT. These contracts have no legal effect, but they show the racism that still lingers in CT’s mostly white suburbs, and mostly minority populated cities. Property owners are able to take out the racist parts of the housing contracts, yet whites only rules still surface now. Other states have made it possible for homeowners to get rid of the racist part of their contracts, but keep the original wording on record in order to not whitewash history. Although racist housing contracts are not enforceable, there is still racial discrimination in CT’s housing today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Important Quotes From the Article</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“David K. Ware, a retired corporate lawyer and candidate for a master of laws degree at the University of Connecticut School of Law recently published a study that uncovered about 250 properties in three neighborhoods in the city of Manchester that had racially restrictive covenants.”</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">“These covenants have not been legally enforceable since 1948, but housing discrimination is alive and well today. Discrimination is not always explicit. Thinly-veiled discrimination is at work today including exclusionary zoning ordinances, redlining, and source-of-income discrimination. Where we live affects every aspect of our lives—our health, safety, education, transportation, access to jobs, and more. This was true pre-1948, and is still true today.”</span></li>

                <p>Keys? Check. Wallet? Check. For most of the world today, there is one more essential item they need before going out: a mask. However, the issue of wearing a mask has led to some conflict, especially in the United States.</p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong><em>Although there are many reasons as to why a person should wear a mask, there are still people asking “Why should I?”</em></strong></p>
<p>For some, the confusion in the beginning may have deterred them from wearing masks. Initially, the CDC sent out conflicting guidelines, saying mask wearing was not necessary. They changed this message on April 3, when they said that it was important to wear a mask. These two different messages may have made people confused, and damaged the credibility of the guidelines. However, there are two reasons for these conflicting messages. One, the CDC wanted to preserve masks for those who really needed it- medical workers. At the start of the pandemic there was a shortage of masks and the CDC wanted to make sure that medical workers were able to get them. Now, more companies are producing masks in order to supply for the demand, and buying reusable masks means that you won’t need to buy any more. The danger of not having enough masks is much less than it was at the start, so the CDC didn’t need to worry about that anymore. The second reason is because of a lack of testing. The less testing there is, the less positive tests for COVID-19. The less positive tests, the lower the count is for the infected. Once testing was able to pick up, the CDC saw that there were more cases than they initially had found. With masks more readily available and a spike in cases, the CDC chose to change their guidelines. As of early August, the CDC has not changed their mind. Masks are important in preventing the spread. With no major change in 4 months, the public should be assured that wearing masks is an important part of keeping COVID-19 at bay and that the CDC is firm in their decision.</p>
<p>Others may be avid followers of influencers, celebrities, and leaders to the point where they follow what they do religiously. Some of these well known people may not believe in wearing masks, or even promote themselves not wearing one. It is important to realize that a vast majority of these people are not health professionals and do not always make the right decision in terms of health. Do research yourself and don’t always follow someone else’s example. It is important to be well informed and make decisions based on what <em>you</em> believe and have researched and not solely on what a single person says or does.</p>
<p>In the end, the most important thing to consider is <em>why</em> you should wear a mask. COVID-19, like any virus, multiplies in your body. This causes the virus to become suspended in body fluids in the lungs, mouth and nose. When a person coughs, they spew droplets containing the virus, and a single cough could produce 3,000 droplets. Even when talking you’re sending out droplets. So what? Maybe you’re not in the same room at the same time as a person and can avoid those droplets, right? Wrong. Larger droplets can collect on surfaces and smaller droplets can stay suspended in the air, with the virus surviving for 3 hours, perhaps longer if the conditions are right. By wearing a mask, you limit the amount of droplets you breathe in and therefore limit your chances of catching the virus.</p>
<p>You might be thinking, <em>I’ll never catch the virus. I don’t have any medical problems, and I’m in the age group that doesn’t get affected. Even if I do get sick, I won’t have it bad.</em> You could be right. You could also be wrong. Many young, healthy individuals are hit hard with the virus. Even if you don’t get sick, the problem is the people you interact with. You may be asymptomatic, and while being unaware of having the virus, you may pass it on to someone who is at a higher risk for it. Your parents, grandparents, even younger people who have a medical issue that you’re unaware of. You may be the reason why they get sick. And that’s what’s so dangerous about this virus. It can be hard to be sure who’s sick and who’s not sick. That’s why wearing a mask is so important. It limits your chances of passing the virus on to others, and others of passing the virus to you.</p>
<p>Many anti mask wearers believe that they have the freedom to not wear a mask. That’s technically true. However, in that same respect, a business has that same right to not allow a person into their store. You have the freedom to not wear a mask, a business has the freedom to not let you in. You cannot have it all, especially when your choice affects the safety of other people.</p>
<p>You don’t have to wear a mask for yourself. But you need to wear it for other people. Why do I, a teenage girl with no underlying health problems, wear a mask? So I can protect my family and friends from getting the virus. If you can’t do it for you, do it for them. Wear a mask.</p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This summer has seen a lot more political and economic tension than ever before in most of our lifetimes. Racism has always been a point of discussion in the United States, especially in a post-Civil Rights Movement era. </span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>However, growing up in South Florida has always gotten me to wonder how racism is handled in other parts of the world, specifically in Latin America.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Perhaps we should start with some history for context. In the early 16th century, the conquistadors landed in the Americas, following Columbus. Their expeditions were pure conquest -- finding land and resources for Spain. Their foreign germs murdered 90% of the native populations and what was left were either chased off, converted to Christianity, enslaved by the Spanish, or a combination of any of these. This could be where racism in Latin America truly started, but there is a key difference: the Spanish conquered for the sake of conquering. The argument could be made that there was hardly real racial motivation for colonizing the Americas, but the argument can be made for the opposite. However, by 1502, African slaves were already in the Caribbean. </span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>This is, arguably, where the true racism began in colonial Latin America.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While indigenous people were enslaved due to conquest, African slaves were a part of the Trans-Atlantic trade system -- also famously called the Colombian Exchange -- and so now the conquistadors found themselves with a question: What will the social hierarchy be? You have ethnocentric Europeans with two different kinds of enslaved peoples. The </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">casta </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">system that the Spanish developed was as follows, roughly: with the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">peninsulares </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at the top (white Europeans from the Iberian peninsula), </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">creoles</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> just under (white Europeans born in the Americas), mestizos and mulattos, followed by indigenous people, and then black slaves all the way at the bottom -- because to the white conquistador, enslaved Africans were lesser than everyone. This was due to a combination of the notion of blood purity and racial segregation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This system of both political, economic, and social hierarchy is most probably the reason for modern-day racism in Latin America. Unlike in the United States, racism in Latin America is based on social and economic class. This may sound similar to racism in the U.S., but in Latin America: if you’re poor, then you’re black. In the United States, racism is often the opposite: if you’re black, then you must be poor. According to an article from the American Quarterly, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As early as 1944, Alejandro Lipschutz, a Chilean anthropologist, coined the idea of Latin America as a ‘pigmentocracy’ -- where the region’s social hierarchies are ethnic or color-based. However, that idea was largely ignored until recently, when research using new census data on racial identification began to document racial inequalities. These studies generally show that Afro-descendant and Indigenous people occupy the lowest rungs on the income, educational and occupational ladders across Latin America.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> But because Latin America as a whole is not the wealthiest of continents, funding and money are often pushed towards other projects. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The social aspect of it is also a factor because while in the United States, “negro” is compared to the n-word, but in Latin America, it is used a fond version of “homie” for people with darker skin. To us in the U.S., this appears to be racist. But in Latin America, oftentimes it’s not used as such. Its connotations depend entirely on the context. “Negrita(/o)” is used as a fond pet name for friends or family with dark skin, even if they’re not black. At the same time, it can be used as a slur as bad as the n-word when thrown around with hate behind it. </span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>Because of all of this, racism is often overlooked. </strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, now this poses the question: how does this racism manifest itself in immigrants who come to the United States? It’s quite an interesting phenomena because here, Hispanics are no longer the majority; they’re the minority. Here in the U.S., they are often greeted with racism towards them, so why are some Hispanics still racist towards other minorities? By all logic, they shouldn’t. </span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>They’re on the same level as them; they’re all facing the same racism and oppression. So, why?  </strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer is very complicated. For one, there is the notion of a sort of “protection.” Latinos are often encouraged to either marry people who are lighter skin than them or marry white people. Marrying lighter skin people has the connotations that you marry rich and that you’re gaining more “protection” from racism. It’s a practice of erasing culture and heritage for the sake of wanting -- what some would call -- a better life. This is the same reason why some Hispanics parents refuse to teach Spanish to their kids -- so that those kids don’t get picked on or have to experience racism like their parents did. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is also, however, a paradoxical feeling of superiority that leads to racism towards other minorities. This is mainly rooted in stereotypes portrayed in the United States that Hispanics families sometimes believe, such as how black people are called “thugs.” This reinforces the classist racism of Latin America, so the line between “poor therefore black” and “black therefore poor” is extremely blurred.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So hopefully this has provided some insight on how racism manifests itself in different parts of the world, but also how it manifests itself when it is in the United States. </span></p>

                <p class="msg msg--highlight "><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong><em>Space is a wondrous place where we can unlock so many secrets of this reality we live in. </em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people think that space travel isn’t important or that the rich are the only ones trying to figure out how to travel since they’ve destroyed Earth so much and don’t want to live in the future filth and I think both those ideas are absurd. First of all, with many different types of discoveries in space, we’ve learned that there are many planets out there that could be habitable and we’ve learned so much about the matter and how anti-matter works. Also, if the rich really wanted to get off of Earth and/or cared about the destruction of this planet, they would’ve funded space exploration a lot more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though the Cold War was a horrible thing, it led to more activity in searching space, we now have satellites, have space stations, have sent someone to the moon, and have done many more things. With things like satellites and telescopes, we’re able to learn more about other planets, and how to either not become like them or to become more like them. Another thing satellites and space stations are useful for is tracking natural disasters, helping our internet, getting information about certain things whether it’s dangerous or not to the people, and helping us predict what will happen in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Space is so much more than just a big empty area that is close and far away from Earth. It’s an area filled with amazing stars, galaxies, planets, and other things. It shows us how we most likely aren’t alone in this universe and how we’re really insignificant compared to everything else. Don’t get me wrong, everyone is still a valued human being, but to accept our insignificance and to look beyond the stars is such an amazing thing and something we could learn from. We could possibly also find alien life in the future whether it’s intelligent or not. Hopefully, it doesn’t find us first though, because as Stephen Hawking said “If aliens visit us, the outcome will be much as when Columbus landed in America, which didn’t turn out well for the Natives”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If more funding is put into space, and more people are interested in learning about it, many more secrets about the universe we live in could be unlocked, the way time and possible time travel works could also be discovered more in-depth. Even if scientists don’t put a lot of funding towards discovering space, they could use things like satellites and better stations to learn more about the Earth and unlock the secrets about our planet and the system.</span></p>

                    <img src="https://blog.thegenz.org/media/posts/56/66A37754-08E5-461F-BA17-31642CFCEA72-maddie-_3.jpeg" alt="&quot;The Stax Museum&quot;" />
                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">People around the world love to listen to and create music. Music has always been a way for people to dance, to celebrate, and to live happy lives. However, music can be more than just a hobby or small enjoyment. Music can help us to change the world. This change has occurred multiple times in the past; now our generation can look at those examples and find ways to utilize our music for <em>change.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">An extremely important example of music inspiring social change is the American Civil Rights Movement. During the 1950s and 60s, many successful musicians, both black and white, used their platforms and music to contribute to the movement. White singers such as Bob Dylan and Joan Baez wrote many songs about the social injustices occurring at the time and devoted large parts of their careers to civil rights. Freedom songs became very popular, especially in the 60s, and they were inspired by black church music. The Staple Singers, originally a gospel group, rose to fame at the height of the civil rights movement. They were signed to Stax Records, a producing company that embodied the collaboration of many different races at a time of social pandemonium. The co-owner of Stax, Jim Stewart, said, “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we've done nothing more, we've shown the world that people of different colors, origins, and convictions can be as one, working together towards the same goal. Because we've learned how to live and work together at Stax Records, we've reaped many material benefits. But, most of all, we've acquired peace of mind. When hate and resentment break out all over the nation, we pull our blinds and display a sign that reads 'Look What We've Done—TOGETHER.'”. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the music that was created, performed, and shared during this time helped immensely in the movement. It inspired people to stand up for what they believed in and provided a sense of courage for those who were hesitant to take part. Music played a huge role in uniting a divided population to fight together for one of the most central movements in American history.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The idea of using music to inspire social change is still relevant today. A global producing company, Community Media for Development (CMFD) Productions, records both music and radio sessions for exactly this purpose. One of their projects, Musicians Against Xenophobia, united musicians from South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Mozambique to produce a small album centered around the social issue of discrimination. Other CMFD projects include multiple songs about HIV awareness, a radio program titled “Hungry City” that discusses the poor state of food security in South African countries, and a radio series about floods in Mozambique in 2013. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Because music is such an important part of popular culture today, it is a perfect platform to raise awareness about social issues. Artists can address their beliefs in person at concerts, reaching hundreds of people at the same time. Songs on the radio are repeated over and over, which drills important messages into people’s minds. When someone learns and sings along to a song, they can then spread the message to others as well as have more understanding for what the song is truly about. Music is not just a form of entertainment. It contains the messages and ideas of artists who are truly passionate about what they believe in. These messages can often be overlooked by the audience. As a generation, it is important for us to stop and listen to what people are trying to say. If we think about what the artists are trying to tell us, we can create a united generation of people who are courageous and inspired enough to bring about social change. We can change the world for the better, one song at a time. </span></p>

                <p class="msg msg--highlight  align-center"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><em><strong>Are sports more harmful or helpful for kids? Sports are more helpful than harmful for kids. Sports are a helpful thing in a child’s life because kids who play sports are more confident, they perform better academically, and get more exercise than the average non playing sports child. </strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sports are helpful for children because kids who play sports have more confidence than those who don’t. Most sports jocks tend to be on the more confident side, but according to the news video, “Kids and Sports”, sports give all kids confidence even if they are not playing for a team or with other kids at all. he video also says that minimal confidence is beneficial to a child. As displayed by facts in the video everyone is more confident if or when they play a sport.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Another way sports are helpful for kids is because kids tend to do better academically when they play a sport. In the news video “Sports: How much is too much?”, the coach of the basketball team says that the kids with overwhelming schedules do better academically, than the ones who have nothing to do. The coach also proves that his statement is correct by saying that when the sports season ends grades drop because the athletes seem to lose focus on their sport and their schoolwork. Sports don’t just help athletes in regular school but in college, because being good at a sport can get you a scholarship to a college, especially if you have good grades too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The last way that sports are helpful for kids is because they help kids get more exercise. Exercise is good for staying healthy and burning calories, most of us know that, but did you know sports help kids prevent a terrible disease. In the article “What in the Name of High School Football?” by Hank Hill, it states, “The single greatest factor in preventing the nation’s number one killer - heart disease - is regular and vigorous exercise”. Children who play sports definitely get regular and vigorous exercise. So just by playing sports children can stay away from the nation’s number one killer. You wouldn’t want to hand your kid to a killer, would you? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In conclusion sports are without a doubt more helpful to kids than harmful. Sports help children socially, academically, and physically. Simply by just playing even one sport children will have more confidence, better grades, and stay away from a killer. If you are wondering whether to put your child on a sports team, if they want to do it, let them. Yes, they can get hurt, but it’s not definite, and it’s probably better than heart disease.</span></p>

                <p class="msg msg--highlight  align-center"><em><strong>During the school year, what do you usually use? Do you grab a plastic bottle of water? If so, then you may not know the benefits of using tap water instead of bottled water!</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Why have bottled water when you could get tap water? Well, tap water is free and much more cost-effective than buying plastic water bottles. If you use tap water, instead of plastic bottled water, you would also be decreasing the amount of waste you use daily. Why waste your money and pollute your world by using plastic water bottles, when you could get tap water? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Water bottles would cost you a lot of money if you continuously buy them. Tap water is much better to use in daily life since it saves you money. In fact, according to Business Insider, water bottles cost 2000 times more than regular tap water. In 2012, around $11.8 billion were spent by Americans on water bottles, reported by the BMC. Imagine the amount of savings that everyone could have if they used tap water instead of bottled water! Americans are spending so much on bottled water that a gallon of bottled water is twice the price of gasoline. When there is a more cost-effective solution than continuously buying bottled water, why should we continue to waste our money?</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight  align-center"><em><strong>Do you throw out your water bottles after drinking them? Well, since you do, tap water is better than bottled water because water bottles create a lot of waste! </strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to The World Counts, every second 1,500 plastic bottles are being thrown into the ocean or in landfills. Obviously, this is a lot of waste, especially when most people can easily use tap water from their own home! Only 1 in 5 plastic bottles are recycled as well. The other 4 are usually thrown away, or they are littered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some may claim that bottled water has a different taste than regular tap water. What if I told you there isn’t any difference? You might have heard that bottled water is cleaner and healthier than tap water, but this is a huge lie! In reality, tap water is as good as bottled water! The World Counts reported that most bottled water is just tap water! Although critics say that there is a huge difference between tap and bottled water, blind tests state that tap water and bottled water taste the same, according to psych central. This imaginary difference between bottled and tap water is one that is costing Americans a lot of money and increasing the amount of waste created!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, tap water is just as good as bottled water, if not, even better! Bottled water is a waste of money, creates too much waste and it has no difference than tap water!  Now that you are informed, try to take steps to drink tap water instead of reaching for a bottle of water. Doing this can help the environment and your wallet!</span></p>

                <p class="msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>According to NDTV, 1 in every 5 people don't get enough sleep every night.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people like to squeeze out a few more extra hours in their day, whether it be for work or recreation, but they sacrifice the wrong thing to do it. Instead of trying to forsake their sleep people should work more efficiently or decide to do it at the later date. Getting enough sleep is especially important during this pandemic as sleeping is the one time when our body can dedicate all resources to fight any germs and diseases that might have infected us.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>Sleep is essential for the physical upkeep of the body, but it also helps maintain cognitive skills, such as attention, learning, memory, and emotional regulation.</strong></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to Erica Jansen, sleep touches almost every aspect of health as it can affect anything from our physical and mental condition the next day to reduce the risk factor of and developing immunity against various diseases and viruses. You might have noticed that one day if you hardly got any sleep, the next day you feel sluggish, moody, and tired. On the other hand, if you got the proper amount of sleep on another day then the day after that you probably felt refreshed, energetic, and maybe even cheerful. All that change came simply from how much sleep you got! Furthermore, according to the CDC, not getting enough sleep can increase one's chances of getting type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Getting more sleep can also drastically improve your performance at getting work done. According to an article written by Ana Sandoiu, not only does sleeping help us learn new things faster, but it also helps to increase the neuroplasticity of our brains. Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to rewire itself and create new connections between neurons. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, sleep can help one be more emotionally stable and reduce their risk of developing a mental health condition. People who don’t get enough sleep will be more prone to getting anxiety and depression which in itself could lead to further sleepless nights. Sleep also helps us to perceive reality correctly. Research suggests that if one doesn't sleep for 3 or more nights they will have perceptual distortions, hallucinations, and delusions. When scientists reviewed their research they were also able to find out that poor sleep, or insomnia, preceded the development of bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Insomnia also increased the chances of one to commit suicide. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now that you have made it this far you are probably wondering if there are any tips as to how to get more/better sleep. One of the best ways that I have found to improve one's sleep cycle is a form of cognitive-behavioral therapy for treating insomnia (CBT-I). To test its effects, Professor Freeman and a few of his colleagues randomly chose 3,755 students with insomnia from 26 different colleges and made them receive either CBT-I or usual care. After some testing, Freeman found that students who received the CBT-I treatment had a more significant improvement in sleep cycles than the students who received the usual care. Not only did the student who received CBT-I have better sleep, but they also experienced less paranoia and fewer hallucinations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When you begin the therapy you first learn about what exactly sleep is and how to change your sleep-related behaviors and thought processes. Then you learn about sleep hygiene which involves things such as limiting naps and not using electronics 30 minutes before or during bedtime. Next, you are taught three behavioral techniques: Sleep restriction, stimulus control, and relaxation. Finally, you learn about a few cognitive techniques, some of which include belief restructuring, mindfulness, imagery, and paradoxical intention. Of course, this is a brief overview of CBT-I but if you think this might help you then I recommend searching about it and understanding it more in-depth. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sleep is a very important factor in maintaining our health and living a happy and fulfilling life. We should try to do our best to get enough sleep in the day otherwise your life might start going downhill before you even realize it. While you might think that you are fine if you get a mere 1 hour of sleep or simply not sleeping at all, you are not. Lack of sleep takes its toll both mentally and physically. </span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">In case you’ve been under a rock for the past few months, we are in the middle of a global pandemic. There is a disease plaguing the world, infecting and killing, with no cure as of yet. Nearly the entire world is under quarantine as to lower the haste of Covid-19’s spread and try to allow hospitals to treat patients at a speed at which they can handle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In all of this, you’d think this would be a time where people would put down their pitchforks and listen to the people that know what’s best for them. You’d think that there would finally be an event where the whole world could agree to put their gatherings on hold and follow social distancing, not for themselves, but for the innocent people they could spread the disease to whom very well could be at risk of death if they caught such a disease. You’d think these things, but it apparently isn’t the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As an example, social media influencer Jake Paul has thrown a party as of recently. A party. Right now. In the middle of a pandemic. You hopefully can see how such a thing is a problem in today’s life as, even if there were precautions made, germs were definitely spread as well as the potential spread of disease. Though, saying precautions were made would be a complete and utter overstatement, as Jake did nothing of the sort. No distancing, no masks, and dozens of party-goers in extremely close proximity to each other. As icing on the cake, there apparently is a possibility that one of the party attendees was infected during the time the party took place. After hearing such news, Jake Paul was barely fazed, saying he wasn’t worried.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> He then said in an interview that he will not promise to stop partying, as “Our leadership has failed us” being his only defense against his actions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As for what we can do to combat this stupidity and recklessness is pretty much nothing. All we can do is take precautions, not for us, but for those innocent people. Use Jake Paul as an example of what not to do. We are still in a pandemic, and we can do better than this.</span></p>

                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The United States produces 6.9 million tons of electronic waste each year and only 12% of it gets recycled according to the EPA. The rate of electronics being produced is five times faster than the growth of the human population itself. All of this electronic waste or e-waste, is made of valuable metals and toxic substances, 50 - 70 % of which is transported to foreign countries, where it accumulates developing into a hazard for the surrounding environment. </span></p>
<p class="align-center msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>But creating massive amounts of electronics requires large amounts of materials that are causing problems in many third-world countries.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong><i>The conflict in DRC:</i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Democratic Republic has been a hotspot of conflict for many years and is currently going through a civil war fueled by the mining of metals. Both sides depend on the metals to finance operations causing a conflict which has taken the lives of 5.4 million people since 1998. These metals are then bought by foreign countries to produce electronics. Robert Hormats, who served as the Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy, and the Environment said that the consequences of mineral mining are “one of the most significant moral issues of our time”. </span></p>
<p><strong><i>Environmental impact: </i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mining for metals is extremely detrimental to the surrounding environment. It contaminates nearby water sources with different types of toxic metals and acids which kills wildlife. A large amount of waste is also produced through the mining process which ends up in the ground or at waste sites. Approximately 80 tons of waste is produced from mining one ounce of gold. The mining of rare Earth elements also requires miners to separate it from radioactive elements. Managing the radioactive waste is also a problem and many are exposed to radiation in the process. One of the largest e-waste dumps in the world is the city of Guiyu in China, where e-waste from all over the world is transported for burning or recycling. The burning of plastics has resulted in 80 % of Guiyu’s children to have high amounts of lead in their blood. Nearby water sources also test high for industrial solvents and metals.</span></p>
<p><strong><i>What you can do to help: </i></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the best ways that you can help slow down the amount of e-waste produced is by lengthening the time you buy devices. Instead of buying the newest phone and chucking the old one every time your brand comes out with a new version, buy a new phone every two or three versions as most phones work fine for more than 3 or 4 years. This is the same with laptops and TVs which can also last very long before needing a replacement. Most cell carriers have deals where you can trade in a phone and it counts towards your purchase of a newer version which is also a great way to reduce the amount of e-waste you produce. The safest way to dispose of electronics is to check for nearby recycling centers for electronics. They can manage the waste and recover metals and parts that can be recycled before getting rid of the waste.</span></p>
