                <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On March 28, 2019, the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Maria Fernanda Espinosa stated that the international community had about 11 years until the effects of climate change were completely irreversible. Since then the emphasis on creating a more sustainable society has been even greater than it has ever been before. In places like Florida, climate strikes occurred and had large followings. In this time of environmental consciousness, many look towards energy production and ponder as to how we can reform it to have less of an environmental strain. While options like wind energy, hydroelectric energy, and solar energy are commonly mentioned in discussions regarding alternative energy sources, however, one form that is usually ignored is nuclear energy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nuclear power as a concept originated in the 1930s with Enrico Fermi’s research on neutrons and their ability to split atoms. Since then, nuclear power has been improved upon and implemented in many nations as a form of creating energy. Nuclear energy is a clean, zero-emission source of energy (U.S Department of Energy), and it has avoided the emission of about 476.2 metric tons of carbon dioxide in the United States in the year 2019 alone (Nuclear Energy Institute). It is also a powerful source of energy. The Ginna nuclear power plant in New York produces about 4,689,440 MWh (U.S Energy Information Administration) In comparison, most wind turbines in the U.S produce a max of 10,000 MW (U.S Energy Information Administration). Not only is it powerful, but it is also highly used in several foreign nations. In Hungary, nuclear energy accounts for about 50.6% of all electricity produced, in Ukraine it is about 53.0%, in France it is as high as 71.7% (International Atomic Energy Agency). Nuclear energy is a highly clean and efficient form of energy production, however it does come with certain flaws. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite nuclear energy being a clean source of energy, it is not a renewable source of energy. According to phys.org, at the current rate at which we use uranium, it will be used up in about 80 years. However, uranium is not the only viable option for nuclear fuel. Other nuclear fuels like plutonium can be used in lieu of uranium and still result in large sums of energy. Another flaw that comes with nuclear energy is the fear of nuclear accidents. Many people envision Chernobyl-Esque disasters when they discuss nuclear energy, however, disasters like these are fairly rare. The most recent nuclear disaster was the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, which was most likely caused by the tsunami which occurred in days before the disaster. Most nuclear accidents occurred because of human error or poor machinery, which we have evolved past. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The switch to nuclear energy may not be the be-all-end-all solution to clean energy production, however, it certainly has potential. From its reliability to its lack of major environmental strain, it seems to have a lot going for it and should be discussed more in conversations regarding alternative energy sources. </span></p>

                <p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong>What is Climate Change?</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Climate change is a major, ubiquitous issue in our society. There are multiple reasons as to why our planet is facing this issue. However, if we don’t start to make a change, climate change will continue to wipe out various species and ultimately us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     The first main promoter of climate change is the act of deforestation. Trees, as we know, create their own food through photosynthesis. For us, this helps take in excess carbon dioxide and create oxygen. The lack of a sustainable amount of trees and vegetation will consequently produce less oxygen and an excess of carbon dioxide will remain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    With the issue of climate change and the current pandemic, this leaves many farmers the option to throw out food most of the time. The rotting produce creates a gas known as methane; this in excess, can be hazardous to all species including us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    There is also a large issue with livestock production as well. Livestock produce approximately 1-2 million tons methane and nitrous oxide per year as a whole. These lethal gases, combined with the emission of CO2, can be hazardous to human health</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     Lastly, there is the growing pandemic of pollution. Pollution can likewise, create harmful gases that can damage biodiversity, especially in our waterway systems and oceans. The pollution can enter water used for drinking supply and contaminate it, becoming a vector for disease.</span></p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Potential Solutions?</strong></p>
<p><strong>   </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">  The largest factor in the issue of climate change is livestock. Since the mass production of livestock is hazardous and arguably unethical, there needs to be lower demand for animal products. Thus, the best way to accomplish this would be to go vegan, or vegetarian. However, if desired, meat may not be removed but instead meat consumption should be limited. That way, an impact will still be made by reducing the demand for meat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     To reduce the amount of waste produced, try to use reusable items instead of one-time use. That way, less plastic is thrown out and produced. Also, water should be conserved and since a higher demand would mean a faster rate for all the freshwater to vanish. This is also related to when the global temperature increases, ice melts quicker, thus more fresh water is wasted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    Lastly, the issue of carbon emission by automobiles needs to be addressed. The obvious answer to fix this is simply to drive less or take the bus. However, due to the current pandemic and social distancing guidelines, this issue is gradually being resolved. Recently, there have been ideas of using biofuel in order to power cars as opposed to gasoline. Biofuel consists of organic matter and may be a cleaner alternative to gasoline.     </span></p>
<p class="msg msg--info"><strong>Community Projects</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">     An interesting community project would be to have a community garden. There, people can rent out a plot and grow whatever they desire. Then they can harvest fresh fruit and vegetables. This garden would provide three functions; a start to the community being educated about climate change</span><strong>, </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">food transportation, and eating less meat. When buying food from a grocery store, that product has a carbon footprint. These include how much water was required to grow, transportation, keeping cool, and driving to the grocery store. Starting a community garden could reduce the amount of carbon generated by air transportation. There can also be a community cleanup. For those who are interested in volunteering, they can meet up and clean up our local community. This would help the ecosystem and biodiversity greatly, as well as giving us a cleaner home.</span></p>

                <p class="msg msg--info">This article is a reflection of the author's views, not necessarily those of the Generation Z Media Organization.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You probably know the story by now. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight "><strong><i>George Floyd, an innocent black male, was suffocated to death for eight minutes by a white cop in Minneapolis. </i></strong></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, protests erupted across America. People burn down shops and buildings in all of the major cities in America. They fought back against riot police, withstanding tear gas and rubber bullets shot at them. For protests and riots like this, I usually think the protestors are troublemakers who damage the society by creating hate and violence to gain more followers for their radical, liberal agenda. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">But this time, as a moderate conservative, I’m siding with Black Lives Matter. Why? </span></em></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The problem with racial injustice in the United States spans for hundreds of years, ever since the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863. Although Abraham Lincoln abolished slavery in the United States, the African-American race has constantly been harassed and discriminated by the Caucasian race. The Jim Crow</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Laws were enacted by the white Democractic-controlled legislatures in many Southern states (Alabama, Georgia, etc.) These racist laws segregated coloured people from the Caucasian people. The “Negros” weren’t able to learn in the same school as Caucasians. It was illegal to have churches host interracial marriages. They had segregated washrooms, designated areas in buses, and even segregating athletes in professional sports leagues. It is also important to note that the Northern states weren’t immune to these laws, as the Jim Crow Laws actually originated in the North when the Southern states still had slavery during the years before the Civil War.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was not until when Rosa Parks refused to give up her bus seat in Montgomery, Alabama, the Civil Rights Movement was in full swing across the United States. Prominent activists like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X fought for equal rights for African-Americans. President Lyndon B. Johnson took notice of this and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1964</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Fourteenth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and Fifteenth</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Amendments came into effect as a result of the movement during the Sixties. It was monumental, as on paper, it eradicated all discrimination from races, genders, relgions, etc. </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, that still wasn’t enough.</span></em></p>
<p><br><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just after MLK was assassinated by James Earl Ray, a white racist, riots erupted in the streets of America again</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The rioting and looting in cities during 1968 were eerily similar to the riots we are currently </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">experiencing right now. Yet, the American government thinks that it has done enough to give equal rights to all people from different backgrounds. Over the course of the next fifty years, the Caucasian race is still experiencing some superiority status that other backgrounds (Black, Latinos, Asians) wouldn’t be able to experience. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s look at some stats, shall we? </span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Data,</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The median household income for African-Americans was $33,255 in 1999, much lower than the $53,356 Caucasian American families owned that same year </span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the 2008 recession, the unemployment rate for African-Americans was 11.1%, higher than the nationwide rate of 6.5%.</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Therefore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment rates would be sky high for African-Americans than the white majority.</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In 2011, 72% of black babies were born to unwed mothers.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The average African-American life expectancy is consistently between five to seven years lower than the average Caucasian Americans.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Do I need more of these stats to prove that there is still racial injustice happening in the United States of America? They clearly show that a huge portion of African-Americans aren’t getting sufficient public health and education than the privileged white majority. When impoverished people can’t afford nutritious meals on the table, they resort to junk food and unhealthy fast food meals for their daily nutrition. This causes higher rates in obesity and diabetes than the national American average</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even if stats aren’t enough to convince some of you, here’s the video link of impoverished communities in America’s major cities. (</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVflUshi0uI"><span style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVflUshi0uI</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) You will understand why there are people rioting and looting in the streets today. They have no future and couldn’t make ends meet. And yet, the footage shows mainly impoverished black-communities, where residents have no choice but to resort to gang-activity and crime. It is important to note that not only black-communities who are facing the borderline poverty problem, but also Asian and Latino communities also.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After researching this issue, I was sickened by the hypocrisy of the American government. They blame other countries for not trying to follow their own patented-democratic philosophy (i.e. China, Russia) and even caused riots in places like Hong Kong, through their espionage networks. (I will write another honest opinion essay on the HK issue) The United States foolishly takes pride as the world’s strongest </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">economy and democractic society when frankly, they did little to nothing to improve the lives of its own citizens. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I supported the Republican Party more than the Democrats. I thought that under the Reagan and Bush 41 administrations, they truly saved America’s economy and helped the country get back on track. I also thought that the Clinton Administration took almost all of the credit when America’s economy was in surplus between 1999-2001</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, due to the former policies of Reagan and Bush 41. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, what made me change? </span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was angered by the Republican’s double-standard party platform. Throughout their history, they are claiming to “help” America under the name of Christ. (Evangelism, Christianity) Yet, they have a more aggressive foreign policy agenda than the Democrats, who more atheists would support</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. As a Catholic myself, I knew that God would want us to have a better world in peace, where we would be kind to each other and accept all people into our Church. However, under God’s name, the Republicans have clearly tried to destroy countries that weren’t following the “American democracy” way. (i.e. Iran-Contra Affair, the War on Afghanistan, the Iraqi War, the Persian Gulf War, etc.) Yes, I obviously know that the Democrats aren’t helping with world peace either (Vietnam War under Kennedy and Johnson), but they weren’t as tightly closed with Evangelism and Christianity as the Republicans. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not only that, but it outrages me further when the Republican Party is trying to advocate for human rights across the world. They are against gay marriage, advocating for stronger police forces in American cities, and even calling for death penalty to continue. Calling out “authoritarian regimes” like China rings a bell of hypocrisy as they literally are advocating for similar things in America. China has death penalty, and so does America. Though I agree that we need better trained police forces and tougher prisons for criminals, America should not call out countries like China as a “police state” when their justice system is similar to their definition of a “police state”. (I really don’t need to tell you the definition of a “police state”. Google it and you’ll come across multiple articles explaining it.) Having stronger police presence in Hong Kong and enacting an extradition bill isn’t a violation of human rights when your county does the same thing. That is hypocrisy. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>You want to know what real human rights are? You might be surprised but China provided the basic human rights its citizens need to live that American simply lacks. I won’t deny that China lacks the freedom of expression and freedom of civil engagement in their country, but they manage to give a sufficient education system, and a much more efficient public health system than America. If you want to know what real human rights record looks like, then look at this chart. (Chart provided in link) You can see that China managed to lift 850 million people out of poverty from the 1980s to 2015. Not only that, but only 3.1% of Chinese citizens are living on or below the poverty line(roughly 42 million). In contrast, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">during the year 2017, around 12.3% of Americans were living below in the poverty line</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. You can say whatever you want about the legitimacy of the Chinese stats, but facts are facts. Like Ben Shapiro said, “facts don’t care about your feelings”. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, African-Americans have suffered enough, even after fighting for hundreds of years to gain equal ground as the white majority. Although I do think these rioters and looters should be detained and that their actions are unacceptable, I now realize the pain and suffering they have experienced on the streets for their entire lives. The American government under both parties (but especially the Republican administrations, including Trump) are ignorant to improve the lives of millions in America, while quickly pointing the finger at countries like China for their human rights record. After seeing multiple incidents where the American government undermined the importance to fix incidents of bad cop interactions with the African-American community (i.e. the currently George Floyd scandal, the 2013 Michael Brown Shooting, the Philando Castille incident), I realized that it was only now that people started to protest and take importance of this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We should have taken actions earlier. I should have taken note of this issue earlier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>But there’s still time to fix this. We must let people know about the racial imbalance in America. Even as my political views are still on the conservative spectrum, I stand with the movement for the first time and proudly shout: “<strong>Black Lives Matter</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">(P.S. I’ll try to make another “Honest Opinion” essay soon. It will be on the Hong Kong Protests and Mainland China. Stay tuned!)</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is the definition of the word “generalize” according to Dictionary.com</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Generalizations are important, they help us to develop stereotypes that can save our lives. I am sure when somebody first met a tiger and it did not end well, the news got around and the generalization from one example that tigers will harm you was made. This led to the stereotype that tigers are ferocious and can and will eat you. This probably has saved many lives. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But, what about when generalizations which have been generations in the making create dangerous stereotypes that infect our society and create fear amongst ourselves?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a study done from 2011-2014 by doctoral student in anthropology at the University of California, Cody T. Ross, found that an unarmed black man was 3.5 times more likely to be shot when compared to a white unarmed man </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">2</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a study done on the Oakland Police Department from 2013-2014 by Rebecca C. Hetey, Benoît Monin, Amrita Maitreyi, Jennifer L. Eberhardt at Stanford University, it was found that the African Americans were overstopped. They also found this effect “was more pronounced when officers indicated that they could determine the race of the person before making the stop”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. They also found that African Americans were handcuffed more and searched more than white people even though white and black people had the same probability to have contraband on them. This statistic was still higher after excluding instances in which an arrest was actually made and contraband was actually found </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">3</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just recently, I had a discussion with someone after they said they would unfollow me because I posted on my social media that #blacklivesmatter and along the way in this conversation he brought up the dangerous stereotype that most black fathers leave their families often. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In America, there are dangerous generalizations at play that lead to dangerous stereotypes of whole groups and/or races of people. Oftentimes (if not all the time) these generalizations are unfair and are the ramifications of our racist past. This has spanned generations, for 100s of years unfair generalizations of black people have led to dangerous stereotypes. For generations we (white people) have viewed black people as lesser, as if they are inherently evil or bad, as if all black fathers leave their children, we have allowed unfair generalizations to span generations. Generalizations that were made off of untrue rumors, false testimonies, lying eye witnesses, wrongful convictions, and unfair examples. Generalizations of a whole race from a few false and/or unfair examples. These generalizations have led to unfair stereotypes in which we are seeing the ramifications of in the form police brutality and many other injustices. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The same goes for the police. We are making generalizations of the horrendous acts of a few to characterize a whole group of people. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We, as a society, must stop making generalizations on whole groups and races of people because these lead to stereotypes that make us fear each other. This fear is what leads to racial profiling, police brutality, and is what empowers white privilege. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, we must admit making generalizations of whole groups of people off of a few people is entirely unfair and leads to dangerous stereotypes. The first step to solving a problem is admitting there is a problem. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Second, to the few people that want to do hateful, awful things, we must not condone their actions. To the murderers of the unarmed black men in America, we must not let them have the power to disrespect the police badge in America. We must vigorously detest these actions and make it known these actions are not okay. And this voice must not only be heard in the black community, but as well among the police officer and white communities also. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, justice must be served in a loving way. We can do this by listening, by protesting, by genuinely saying “I am here, and I am listening, and I do care.” If we respond hate with hate, violence with violence, we are no better than the people that did the hateful thing in the first place. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, and this is the most important, let us make every effort to serve one another humbly in love. Let’s listen to each other. Let’s stand hand in hand with each other. Let’s peacefully protest with each other. Let's see our different races, and let’s say “this is beautiful”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Listen, we are not tigers, we are people. Our different colors of skin should not inspire fear and hatred, but instead it should inspire love. My white friend is just as beautiful as my black friend who is just as beautiful as my Indian friend who is just as beautiful Asian friend who is just as beautiful as my Latino friend and so on and so forth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But the only way we can be beautiful is if we are beautiful together, standing hand in hand together in love. </span></p>

                <p class="msg msg--highlight "><em><strong>Fifty-five years ago, the raging fire of the African American Civil Rights movement found itself among the black residents of  Selma, Alabama.</strong></em></p>
<hr>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Six hundred people attempted to march from Selma to Montgomery to demand equal voting rights and protest the murder of Jimmie Lee Jackson, a peaceful black demonstrator shot  by an Alabama State trooper. The marchers led by U.S. Representative John Lewis and Hosea Williams attempted to get past the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where they were met by a wall of Alabama State troopers. The peaceful protestors were brutally tear gassed and charged with Billie Clubs and Nightsticks. 67 people were injured critically, and the eyes of the world were on Selma, Alabama. The event that is today remembered as Bloody Sunday was one of the most disgraceful moments in our history, a day in which American values were questioned by the forces of hate, and ignorance.  This historic event occurred only 235 miles from Tallahassee, Florida.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">I had the privilege of interviewing several participants in the Selma Voting Rights movement, in a recent trip to Selma.  Ms. Jo Ann Bland, a participant in several of the Selma-Montgomery marches, speaking about Bloody Sunday, stated, “I hope no one ever has to relive that moment.”  Ms. Diane Harris, another demonstrator during the event,  added how state troopers arrested people regardless of their age, and noted children as young as nine also found themselves being taken to prison.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">The efforts of the demonstrators  were not in vain. Their work saw the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965,  a landmark piece of legislation that ensured voting rights to all people regardless of the color of their skin. Today, as the voting season comes upon us, it is important for us to remember the blood, sweat, and tears that went into the creation of legislation to protect the rights of all voters.  By voting, not only can we do our civic responsibility as citizens of the United States of America, we can honor the efforts of the activists, demonstrators, and leaders that helped make America a better place.</p>

<hr>
<p>I am not the quintessential “ideal student.” I procrastinate a lot. My handwriting is not the greatest. Just recently, one of my teachers jokingly (I hope) told me that it was easier to decipher handwriting from the 19th century than mine. And much to the chagrin of my teachers, I often forget including the date, and class period, at the top right corner of my sheet of lined paper. But as I sit and reflect on these gaffes, I also realize that our teachers are some of the most pivotal people in our lives. They do not just teach us. They mentor us, they guide us, and most importantly they look out for us. This week is teacher appreciation week, and we need to remember the hard work teachers do, and the sacrifices they make for us students.<br>Despite everything teachers do for us, we occasionally forget that our teachers are “normal human beings.” Often, we evade out teachers at a neighborhood grocery or look in awe if we see them at a movie theater. However, we need to remember that our teachers too, have children, family, loved ones, and pets, like the rest of us. They are doing their jobs, while going through the same hardships that we all are facing currently. Just a few days back my math teacher’s dog passed away, yet the next day, she was on Microsoft Teams, checking in with us, and making sure that we were understanding lesson content. My aunt, a high school teacher, is taking care of her husband-- a cancer patient, while teaching programming languages to her students through Zoom. Our teachers, like front line workers across the nation, are selflessly doing their job, so that we, as students, can be better prepared for challenges that are yet to come.</p>

<p><br>During this crisis, lesson plans have gone awry, and teachers have had to adapt to virtual teaching platforms often at very short notice, overcoming hurdles that would have seemed insurmountable a few months ago. Across the country, teachers have responded with remarkable alacrity and resolve; they are following up with us, ensuring that we stay safe, and have offered us their thoughts and personal cell numbers to reach out to.<br>As a student attending a Title I school, I know that many of my peers are struggling to access digital resources. Yet, undaunted by this digital divide, my teachers are going out of their way to print out packets and are often personally delivering them to their students. Our teachers did not sign up to serve as human shields during school shootings, but they did that. Our teachers did not sign up to teach in the middle of a global pandemic, yet they are doing just that. Their strength of character, and willingness to help us under all circumstances is visible and tangible in our lives.<br>Despite this, we students complain about mundane things. Even now, I noticed how my peers and I were whining about extra credit opportunities. In retrospect, I can realize how petty that is. We simply cannot take our teachers for granted. Sometimes we forget the time a teacher helped us out when we faced a stressful situation, or when they stayed after school, just to make sure that we understood a concept. Sure, we can recognize our teachers for the hard work they are doing in a specific week meant for “teacher appreciation,” but let us resolve to appreciate our teachers regardless of the time. When we get back to school, let us remember how our teachers scheduled individual calls with us to make sure that we were alright. Let us remember how our teachers had to discard lesson plans that they made months in advance and become proficient in software applications that they would have rarely used otherwise.<br>Next time, when you are turning in your assignment, type a small thank you note for your teacher, or ask them if they are doing well. Our teachers do everything for us but ask for little in return. They could have been anything they wanted to, yet they chose to be teachers, so that they could help us achieve our dreams. Our teachers have invested more in the future of our country, than any hedge fund, or investment bank. The least we students can do… is to appreciate them.</p>
