Most of us have heard of it by now. Practiced by nearly thirty-six million Americans and celebrities to the likes of Robert Downey Junior, Matthew McConaughey, and Madonna</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Yoga has become a quintessential and popular lexicon of American popular culture and life. A twelve-billion-dollar industry and growing, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoga is no doubt a massive part of America's fitness industry and of our economy. Yet as the popularity of Yoga has continued to grow, the true essence and purpose of it has begun to deteriorate.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoga originated in the Indian subcontinent thousands of years ago. An important aspect of Hindu and later Jain and Buddhist Culture, Yoga was described in the Vedas and later in the Patanjali Yoga Sutra as a method to attain mental clarity and self-realization. The west was introduced to Yoga in the late 19th century by the Hindu monk Swami Vivekananda</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. A disciple of the mystic Sri Ramakrishna, Vivekananda eloquently described the prowess one could gain through the diligence and practice of physical Yoga as well as things such as Bhakti Yoga, Jnana Yoga and Karma Yoga, the yoga of devotion, knowledge and work respectively.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Yoga is intrinsically a pillar of Hinduism, as stated by the journal Hinduism Today</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> \"The roots of yoga, its scriptural origins, are Hindu. The stem of yoga, its practice, is Hindu; and the flower of yoga, mystical union with God, is Hindu. Yoga, in its full glory, is entirely Hindu.\" This reality has been accepted by leaders of religious institutions, but the behemoth that is the American fitness industry has taken a different approach to market yoga— rebranding it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States has thousands of Yoga Studios, yet of these studios very few acknowledge the origins of Yoga. My mother, a certified Yoga teacher and member of a national yoga teacher association</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, indicated that her course content stated that Yoga was an \"ancient\" practice. No mention of India. No mention of Hinduism and no mention of the significance the practice of Yoga has to billions of Hindus. Apparently, the course had gone on to discuss explicitly Hindu ideas such as those of the \"Chakras\" yet again referred to them as \"ancient.\" This is what is the most concerning. Practicing Yoga and refusing to acknowledge the roots of it is cultural appropriation, plain and simple.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just like many aspects of African American and Black Culture, Yoga has been taken and repurposed to serve a different audience all while forgetting to attribute proper credit. Yet as Sanskrit words such as \"Mukha Svanasana\" and \"Ananda Balasana\" are appropriated into terms such as \"downward dog\" and \"happy baby\" we must remember that erasing something doesn’t make it our own. Instead, let’s try to recognize the contributions made in our life not just by the Hindu monks that developed the practice of Yoga thousands of years ago, but also by the people of all cultures and backgrounds who have developed the things that shape our lives. </span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em>Citations</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/a708863/celebrities-who-do-yoga/\">https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/a708863/celebrities-who-do-yoga/</a><a href=\"https://www.womenshealthmag.com/uk/fitness/a708863/celebrities-who-do-yoga/\"></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/pilates-yoga-studios-industry/#:~:text=trends%20outlined%20above.-,Pilates%20%26%20Yoga%20Studios%20in%20the,industry%20trends%20(2014%2D2019)&amp;text=Furthermore%2C%20an%20estimated%2080.0%20million,of%205.1%25%20to%20%2412.8%20billion\">https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/pilates-yoga-studios-industry/#:~:text=trends%20outlined%20above.-,Pilates%20%26%20Yoga%20Studios%20in%20the,industry%20trends%20(2014%2D2019)&amp;text=Furthermore%2C%20an%20estimated%2080.0%20million,of%205.1%25%20to%20%2412.8%20billion</a><a href=\"https://www.ibisworld.com/united-states/market-research-reports/pilates-yoga-studios-industry/#:~:text=trends%20outlined%20above.-,Pilates%20%26%20Yoga%20Studios%20in%20the,industry%20trends%20(2014%2D2019)&amp;text=Furthermore%2C%20an%20estimated%2080.0%20million,of%205.1%25%20to%20%2412.8%20billion.\">.</a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21045281\">https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21045281</a><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-21045281\"></a></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5673\">https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5673</a><a href=\"https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=5673\"></a></span></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.yogaalliance.org/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">https://www.yogaalliance.org/</span></a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \"><em><strong>Simply put, it is impossible to support racist actions and behavior because of how racism presents itself. </strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Racism is one of the most unjustifiable qualities of humankind since the dawn of time. It is nothing but a generalization of hatred and discrimination against people of a race based on information untrue to most people in that race. For example, non-black people may view blacks as inferior because they see multiple scenarios of blacks being culprits of crimes on the news. These scenarios become general stereotypes which only make up a small percentage of that race. Arguably the worst instances of racism are when authoritative or crucial decisions are made against people of a certain race, especially when said people are punished harshly for petty crimes, or even, no real crime at all. For the past few months, police brutality against blacks has become one of America’s greatest issues, sparking multiple riots nationwide. </span></p>\n<p><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But after all these centuries of discrimination against blacks, why does police brutality still exist in society today?</span></i></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To answer this question, it is necessary to understand how racism came to be and how its analogous “layers” have been shed over time. Up until the Renaissance period, there had not actually been nearly as much racism found in comparison to the highly racist future that would soon come to be. In the early seventeenth century, Europeans started coming into contact with people of darker skin during the Renaissance, which was how they first came across the idea of colored people being inferior. They kidnapped several Africans and exploited them to work as servants, with the first slaves arriving in the American colonies in 1619. For over two hundred years, the number of slaves in the nation grew to four million.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It wasn’t until the Civil War in the 1860s when slavery was abolished. President Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation essentially gave the four million slaves freedom once the Union won the war against the pro-slavery Confederates. But while this was the end of slavery, this was absolutely </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">not</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> the end of racism, especially towards blacks. For another one hundred years, whites and people of color were segregated in nearly every aspect of life, including education, seating on public buses, public bathrooms, and more. In the 1960s, segregation was finally put to an end. Since then, people of all colors and races in America were made equal. But, yet again, this was not the end of racism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While everyone in America has been </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">technically</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> considered equal (in the sense that everyone in the US or is a citizen has equal voting rights, same laws to follow, etc.) the stigma against blacks still remains inside certain people’s minds, and is yet another layer that must be shed. Unfortunately, that includes people in law enforcement. For so many years, blacks have been taking worse punishments (and even getting killed) by the police far more often than other races for similar crimes, and it absolutely should not be the case. At that point, everyone’s equality doesn’t matter if certain people are being killed by the police for trivial crimes--and the more horrifying truth--</span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">no crime at all</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Essentially, police (especially white ones) are trying to take care of problems by generalizing blacks as the enemy. Perhaps the most prominent incident was George Floyd’s death on May 25, 2020, where Floyd was arrested after passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a grocery store, and was killed by officer Derek Chauvin later. Chauvin killed him by inflicting eight minutes and forty-six seconds of complete torture to Floyd and everyone watching. For that amount of time, Floyd couldn’t breathe as Chauvin put his knee to Floyd’s neck.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Seeing as how many similar incidents there were and the countless riots and protests across the nation, it is clear these acts of police brutality are supposed to be a problem of the past. They do not and did not have any justifiable place in our society. So, in order to get rid of these acts forever, should the police be defunded? That is a very controversial topic, but ultimately, defunding the police would allow for a fresh start with a brand new law enforcement system. Also, the money that once went to police can now be used to help other causes.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now, you may be wondering, </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">what does police brutality have to do with America’s history of slavery and segregation?</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Essentially, police brutality is just another unjustifiable form of racism that has no right nor reason to exist in the modern world. Slavery and racial segregation are two forms of racism that have been long gone in America. It’s like a layer of racism that remains after the more racist layer surrounding it was removed. The core of racism is something that cannot be destroyed, unfortunately, because there will </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">always</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> be racist people out there (albeit the core has no real impact on an entire society). But just for right now, America needs to find out a way that would ultimately shed the layer of police brutality. Once that happens, it will be just as important and iconic as the moments in history when slavery was abolished and when America became desegregated. Slavery, racial segregation, and police brutality are three layers of unjustifiable racism that shall never be seen in America (and hopefully, the rest of the world) again.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em>Citations</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Fredrickson, George M. “RACE - The Power of an Illusion .

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social comparison, primarily in social media, is an issue that youth have to tackle everyday. Not only have I heard about this topic, I have experienced it. Social media often portrays unrealistic beauty and lifestyle standards that kids and teens think they are expected to live up to. Along with social media there are major comparisons in school, sports, economic status, and more. I believe that there are things we can do to lessen this comparison and therefore relieve stress and anxiety. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Social media is arguably one of the biggest influences in a teenager and young adult's life. Although there are other aspects of comparison in today's fast paced society, I believe that social media has the greatest effect on youth. Everyday there is a new “trend” or style that gets millions of views in a matter of seconds. Fun TikTok dances or new makeup styles are great examples. It can be damaging to a developing mind to constantly be compared to people who have millions of followers or what society says is the “perfect body type”. I am not trying to take away from the positive opportunities on these platforms however, I think that there are ways we can improve these platforms to be more positive and welcoming rather than judgmental and comparable. Whether it is the clothes you wear, the sports you play, or the vacations you go on, people will see those posts and compare you to someone or something without even intending to. Seeing posts about a party you weren’t invited to could have negative effects on your mental health. I think that we have grown up to compare people based on what we see and hear about them rather than making our own opinions about them. Studies have shown that about 25% of teens have said that the effects of social media are mostly negative. This needs to change.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To lessen the stress and anxiety that are caused by comparison we need to change how we think. We are raised to be competitive in today's society and that is okay. Posting to put others down, however, is far from okay. On social media if you see something, say something! These platforms are also a great place to boost each other's confidence and encourage positivity. Together we can create a society to decrease the social comparison in youth today.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Citations</em></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anderson M, Jiang J.

But the story doesn’t begin there. And it certainly doesn’t end there either.  Calls for social and political change have prompted a push for reform and overhaul of law enforcement.  However, it is impossible to discuss proper reform of policing and law enforcement in the United States as a whole without properly discussing the prominent issues surrounding the discussion. Some believe that the response from activist groups such as Black Lives Matter and their ever-increasing following are disproportionate to recent events. Others believe that prominent supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement aren’t going far enough. But where does all this tension come from? And how will all this affect us in the future?</span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong><em>What is Systemic Racism?</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The United States has had a long and terrible history with racism and racial inequality. In his book, “Racist America: Roots, Current Realities, and Future Reparations” sociologist Joe Feagin states that systemic racism is a popular way of explaining, within the social sciences and humanities, the significance of race and racism both historically and in today's world. Feagin claims that the United States was founded in racism since the Constitution classified black people as the property of whites. Feagin illustrates that the legal recognition of racialized slavery is a cornerstone of a racist social system in which resources and rights were and are unjustly given to white people and unjustly denied to people of color. In summation, the theory of systemic racism accounts for individual, institutional, and structural forms of racism.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">  </span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center msg msg--highlight \"><em><strong>The History of Black Lives Matter and The Civil Rights Movement </strong></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Black Lives Matter is a phrase that no longer simply refers to the activist organization, but is used to refer to the greater civil rights movement as a whole. Because of recent events, people conjoin the two as simply “The Black Lives Matter Movement”.  However, it is also important to consider that Black Lives Matter (the organization) and the greater Civil Rights movement have separate histories. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Civil Rights Movement began in the 1940s after the World War II, with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) began by fighting against segregation, discrimination in public recreational facilities, and restrictive covenants in transportation and housing. In 1954, the US Supreme Court made a historic ruling, outlawing segregation in the public school system. This caused backlash from racist groups of white Southern citizens, who used economic pressure, legal maneuvers and violence to strike against the Civil Rights Movement. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It would be impossible to discuss the Civil Rights Movement without mentioning Martin Luther King Jr… He organized the 1955-1956 bus boycott in Montgomery, Alabama. It was a peaceful protest brought on by Rosa Parks’ arrest after she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a segregated bus. In 1956, the Supreme Court ruled segregation of public transport unconstitutional. King would later go on to leave several successful sit-ins and marches in Birmingham, Alabama, and Washington, D.C. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 at the age of 35 and gave all his prize money to the Civil Rights Movement. The activist Malcolm X founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity in the early 1960s, pushing a less than peaceful message of  Black Power. He was assassinated in 1965. Just three years later, Martin Luther King Jr. would die in the same way. Even after their deaths, their message continues to resonate with people around the world, and this inspired many to form their own organizations to fight injustice wherever it may occur. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Black Lives Matter Foundation was formed by Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors, and Opal Tometi in response to the killing of 17-year old Trayvon Martin. According to the organization’s website, their mission is to “eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.” Black Lives Matter also actively advocates for Black innovation and pushes for greater amounts of Black representation in politics and culture. Their focus also includes women and a portion of the LGBTQ+ community, who may not have organizations available to represent them. The Black Lives Matter Foundation does not have a central structure of a hierarchy and instead works through local chapters with individual leadership. The organizations regularly organize protests to speak out against issues such as  inequality, racial profiling, police brutality, and the killing of blacks. It is also important to note that Black Lives Matter activists tend to fall on the more radical side of social change. For example, One of Black Lives Matter’s staple chants is “no justice, no peace”, and after the acquittal and total exoneration of police officer Darren Wilson, 300 Black Lives Matter activists were arrested after protests turned violent and multiple fires broke out in the city of  Ferguson, Missouri. In 2015, A radio host that was affiliated with Black Lives Matter agreed with an anonymous caller suggesting that black people should murder whites people, quoting that they should “hang them from a tree, take pictures of it and send it to mother f*ckers.” In November 2015, Black Lives Matter members at the University of Missouri demanded a “blacks only healing space” where white “allies” and sympathizers of their cause were kicked out. This form of segregation was  in response to perceived “racial injustices” and “white privilege” at the college. In 2016, at a Black Lives Matter Protest in Portland, Oregon protesters began advocating the killing of cops, quoting “You pull out your pistol and you bust them”. In response to the death of Eric Garner at the hands of Daniel Pantaleo, a New York City Police Officer,  Black Lives Matter protesters chanted “What do we want? Dead cops. When do we want them? Now!”. In July 2016, members of Black Lives Matter refused to sell a white supporter a Black Lives Matter because the t-shirts were reserved for blacks only. Despite these moments of controversy, Black Lives Matter still claims that its overall mission has not changed, a claim which is supported by their success in spreading awareness about the issues that black people face. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On May 25, 2020, 46-year-old George Floyd, a black man, was killed by  Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who pressed his knee into the neck of the complacent and handcuffed George Floyd, killing him, but not before Floyd cried out several times that he was unable to breathe. The tragedy resulted in several protests breaking out across the world. While the majority of the protests were peaceful, many turned into riots, causing violence, arson, and widespread looting. As a response, US cities implemented curfews, and certain cities even called in the National Guard. Of course, these riots are not without casualty. On June 2, a Las Vegas police officer was shot. On the same day, a 77-year-old retired St. Louis police captain was killed by looters at a pawn shop. In Indianapolis, 2 people were killed during the riots, one of which was former Indiana University lineman Chris Beaty.  A 21-year-old man died in Detroit after shooting began during a riot.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, these events have provoked multiple instances of protests and calls for action all over the world. The Black Lives Matter Foundation has taken this opportunity to pursue a new goal, which is a nation-wide defunding of the police. </span></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But what exactly does it mean to ‘“defund the police?\"</span></em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight align-center\"><strong><em>Defund the Police?</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To begin with, there are many misconceptions about the widespread call to “Defund the Police”. Some believe that it calls for total removal of the police force in certain cities and districts. Politicians such as Alexandra Ocasio Cortez have explained that ”Defund the Police” only entails the shifting of funding away from police and instead investing it in poorer communities and towns who were victims of racist practices in the past (more on that later). “Defund the police” may be the most popular solution to police brutality, but it certainly isn't the only one. Less radical political groups and figures have shown support for increased police training and harsher punishments for police officers who violate police code. Doing so would result in increased accountability and awareness about police misconduct on the line of duty. Rep. Jim Clyburn, Democrat  from South Carolina explained that despite calls defunding the police, it would not happen. Instead, he called on his fellow members of Congress to work with him on a “reimagining” of the police system. “I would simply say, as I have always said, nobody is going to defund the police,” Clyburn said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “We can restructure the police forces, restructure, reimagine policing,” Clyburn said. “That is what we are going to do. The fact of the matter is, the police have a role to play. What we have got to do is make sure that their role is one that meets the times, one that responds to these communities that they operate in.” Clybrun’s words are in line with what the rest of Congress is planning to do, which is reforming police without defunding it. That being said, just why is “Defund the Police” so hotly debated?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The issue at hand is that police represent such an integral part of society. The responsibilities of the average police officer go far beyond catching criminals. When someone suggests defunding them, it’s easy to assume that the police will become less capable of fulfilling their responsibilities. Defunding the police is not a simple matter and requires careful planning and implementation, that when done correctly could result in impactful support and social change for people who were victims of institutionalized racism. However, every city in the United States is different, and each local government handles its budget differently. People who support the Black Lives Matter movement tend to advocate for defunding the police, but do not consider the fact that not all police departments are “overfunded” and that all poorer neighborhoods who may need financial support are the direct result of institutionalized racism. Lastly, it can not be overstated that not all cops contribute to police brutality. Many cops have stood in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement, giving support to the calls for reform. Despite all this, there are still those who deny that radical change demanded organizations like the Black Lives Matter Foundation is needed. </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong><em>All Lives Matter</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While the Black Lives Matter Foundation was created with a specific goal in mind as an activist organization, the same cannot be said for  #AllLivesMatter. The hashtag began appearing as soon as the popularity of Black Lives Matter began to skyrocket in response to the death of George Floyd. It was used as a sort of response to people spreading #BlackLivesMatter all over the internet. #AllLivesMatter stems from a misconception- that the statement ‘Black Lives Matter’ means that ONLY black lives matter. When in reality, that is not what the statement entails. The statement is meant to highlight the injustice and mistreatment faced by black people throughout history and campaign for social and political change that will help put an end to racism once and for all.</span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong><em>Social Media and Activism</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A positive side of the recent events is that many celebrities, politicians, and ordinary people young and old alike have taken to social media as a method of activism. Thanks to the rise of the internet, it is now easier than ever to spread the word about petitions and rallies to foment change in our communities. With silence being frowned upon by all sides, calls for people to express their views are louder than ever, resulting in large instances of messages being shared and debated online. However, the question still remains as to whether these messages plastered all over social media can be considered activism. Former President Barack Obama spoke about social media and activism, saying “there is this sense that 'the way of me making change is to be as judgmental as possible about other people and that's enough.... That's not activism. That's not bringing about change. If all you're doing is casting stones, you're probably not going to get that far. That's easy to do.”</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anyone with an Instagram account can post a five-second story with the hashtag: </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">BlackLivesMatter</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. But how many have gone out of their way to organize a protest, or a letter writing campaign? Ever since the rise of social media, the way that our society deals with current events has changed. Apps like Twitter and YouTube have ‘trending’ sections. Much of what people see and interact with has to do with whether it is trending. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">That being said, social media is still a potent method of spreading awareness about a topic. Controversy is one of the most common ways that something can go viral, especially considering the heated political climate of the United States. </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong><em>The Politics of  Racism</em></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Though many would argue that the issues raised by Black Lives Matter and other such institutions do not necessarily need to be political and should instead be regarded as societal, it is also important to consider that much of the changes demanded by organizations like Black Lives Matter and Antifa are analogous with that of political change, and require political support to be turned into law. The most important discrepancy occurs when considering the issues on the racism of the past, and how it may still have an impact today. Many conservatives argue that systemic racism is not an issue. They use statistics to show that police are more likely to shoot white people than black people and that police are also less likely to shoot unarmed black suspects than unarmed suspects.  According to American Free Press’s Peter Papaherakles, “For every black killed by a white police officer in the U.S. every year, there are about 71 blacks killed by other blacks.” This data was backed up by FBI data from 2007-2012 as well as the </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wall Street Journal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. Many attribute the leftist claims about systemic racism to the practice of “redlining”. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Redlining is a process in which institutions such as banks will refuse to offer mortgages or offer worse rates to customers in certain predetermined neighborhoods selected on the basis of their racial and ethnic composition. This is clearly an example of institutionalized racism in the United States. However, this practice was outlawed in 1968. Despite this, some argue that black people today still feel the effects of Redlining, pointing to the lack of government resources and support in order to make up for the utter lack of basic health and services like banking, healthcare, transportation and job opportunities. Conservatives address these claims by saying that government vouchers exist to help those in need, while liberals insist on a more widespread solution, calling for the government to spend more on neighborhoods that may have been affected by red-lining. Such arguments can be traced back to the differences between party platforms concerning the role of government as a whole. Many hoped that the United States would pull together to put an end to the numerous crises that the country is facing, but if anything, we are more divided than ever. </span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center msg msg--highlight \"><em><strong>The Future: What’s Next for America</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is a difficult time for all of us. All around the world, the loss of stability, security, and human life, seems to affect every single community. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Everyone wants to return to their normal lifestyle, but analysts assure us that things won’t ever be the same. What exactly do they mean?</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is  a time of great instability, it is also a time in need of great reform. It is easy to see that we are far from the “status quo”, but we must come to terms with the fact that the “status quo” is at least partially, responsible for our dire situation. Things cannot go back to the way they were. The Constitution of the United States was written as a living document for a reason. It was Abraham Lincoln who said “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” Now more than ever, that is true. If we continue to politicize every single issue and become outraged at everything we disagree with, our nation will continue to be divided. We can attain a prosperous future only through cooperation and compromise. For this reason, I urge that we forget our party affiliations, that for just a moment, we forget our rage and our hate, that for just a moment we can negotiate and find a solution that will work for us. We must stop seeing what makes us different and start looking for solutions, because this is more than a fight against injustice or a pandemic. This is a fight for America, and if we lose, we have only ourselves to blame.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citations</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bazelon, Emily. “Police Reform Is Necessary.

            "content_html": "<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><strong><i>Sports are beginning to make a comeback. The way they are doing it differs by sport, but is a bubble necessary?</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After the coronavirus forced many sports to shut down, they are now beginning to start back up. The NBA is resuming its season with a bubble at the Walt Disney World Complex in Orlando, Florida. Twenty two out of thirty total teams have been invited to play “seeding” games in order to determine playoff standings. Then, the NBA postseason will begin. The NBA is very determined to keep the integrity of the bubble. Players and staff are constantly tested for covid-19 and are required to wear masks. Anyone entering the bubble must quarantine themselves before joining their team, and anyone leaving the bubble must let the NBA know. Since NBA teams have been arriving to the bubble in early July, the integrity of the bubble has kept up, and there have been no reported cases. Additionally, other leagues, such as the NWSL, MLS, and the WNBA, all have returned by instituting a bubble. In all of these leagues, there was not a single reported case of covid-19 after the initial quarantine stage. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The MLB has also begun their season. They too have instituted new rules to keep players and staff safe, such as shortening the season, playing games without fans, testing personnel, and even banning spitting on the field. However, unlike the NBA, they are playing without a bubble. Teams still have to travel back and forth, and players do not have to be in isolation. Perhaps due to the lack of a bubble, there was a major coronavirus outbreak. Less than a week into the MLB season, seventeen people on the Miami Marlins tested positive for coronavirus. For now, the next six games for the Marlins have been canceled, and there is a sense of uncertainty of whether the Marlins’s season, or even the league’s season, will have to be canceled. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Two major sports have yet to begin their season, football and hockey. The NHL is planning to restart its season with two bubble cities, one in Edmonton and another in Toronto. On the other hand, the NFL plans to begin its season with no bubble in place. The recent outbreak in the MLB, as well as the close physical contact between players that football entails, many are worried about the NFL season. Many different leagues have shown that a bubble works, while the MLB showed why a bubble is necessary. As sports look to continue during a pandemic, a bubble seems to be the only way to do it safely.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em>Citations</em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Colin Ward-Henninger  &amp; . “NBA Disney World Rules: Details of How the Bubble Will Work as League Plans to Resume Play in Orlando.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CBSSports.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 17 July 2020, www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-disney-world-rules-details-of-how-the-bubble-will-work-as-league-plans-to-resume-play-in-orlando/.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Macaya, Melissa, et al. “Here's How MLB Will Conduct Its Upcoming Season.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CNN</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cable News Network, 30 June 2020, www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-pandemic-06-29-20-intl/h_4b0a40baa65fcec05a2527769149a0cd.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Radnofsky, Louise, et al. “The Sports Bubbles Are Working, So Far.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Wall Street Journal</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Dow Jones &amp; Company, 23 July 2020, www.wsj.com/articles/the-sports-bubbles-are-working-so-far-11595502000.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sanchez, Ray, and David Close. “Miami Marlins Coronavirus Outbreak Grows with Four More Players Testing Positive.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CNN</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cable News Network, 28 July 2020, www.cnn.com/2020/07/28/us/mlb-miami-marlins-coronavirus-spt-trnd/index.html.</span></p>\n<p> </p>",

One of the best ways to do that right now is using a mask or face shield. </strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Face masks are essential as not only do they protect you from the virus, they also help protect others by reducing exposure to saliva and other respiratory secretions released by the mask wearer. Masks basically kill two birds with one stone as not only are you protected, but so are others around you. As the Mayo Clinic states, masks function by “protecting the wearer’s nose and mouth from contact with droplets, splashes and sprays that may contain germs.” Additionally they filter out large particles in the air further keeping the user protected from the virus. As outlined by the Mayo Clinic, a few pointers for putting on and taking of your maks are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Placing your mask around both your mouth and nose. If even one of them is exposed then you are at risk of contracting the virus.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not touching your mask while you are wearing it.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you touch your mask, wash or sanitize your hands immediately.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Washing your hands immediately after taking off your mask.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If one simply follows all of these guidelines then they can significantly reduce their chances of getting infected. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America (PNAS), masks significantly reduce the spread of the virus and that other countermeasures such as social distancing are not nearly as effective as masks are. A study by PNAS showed that simply wearing face masks prevented over 78,000 infections in Italy between April 6 and May 9 and over 66,000 infections in New York City between April 17 and May 9. As the statistics show, wearing a mask can drastically decrease the rising number of cases with little to no effort on our part. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While many states have taken the initiative and made masks mandatory, I believe that all states should implement this to make sure that the number of cases can finally start going back down again. No one is completely immune to the virus and to prevent any more casualties from occurring we must prevent the virus from spreading any further. Above all we must learn to have patience in these troubling times. If we had been a little more patient then the number of cases wouldn’t be rising at such a fast rate again. I get that it can be annoying to be stuck at home for so many months but it will ensure that we are not stuck at home longer than we need too. After all, the faster people start following all the precautions, the faster the number of cases will go down, and eventually leading the country to reopen faster.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citations</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Can Face Masks Protect against the Coronavirus?” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mayo Clinic</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research, 17 July 2020, www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/in-depth/coronavirus-mask/art-20485449.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim, Allen, et al. “These Are the States Requiring People to Wear Masks When out in Public.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CNN</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cable News Network, 17 July 2020, www.cnn.com/2020/06/19/us/states-face-mask-coronavirus-trnd/index.html.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Kim, Allen. “Best Way to Reduce Coronavirus Transmission Is by Wearing a Face Mask, Study Finds.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">CNN</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Cable News Network, 12 June 2020, www.cnn.com/2020/06/12/health/coronavirus-mask-wellness-trnd/index.html.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zhang, Renyi, et al. “Identifying Airborne Transmission as the Dominant Route for the Spread of COVID-19.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">PNAS</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, National Academy of Sciences, 30 June 2020, www.pnas.org/content/117/26/14857.</span></p>\n<p> </p>",

            "content_html": "<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>What is Global Warming?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The World has experienced colossal changes in the last century. One of the biggest changes is global warming. The basic definition of global warming is that in the last 50 years years, the average global temperature has been increasing rapidly. This is mainly due to the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Yes, the very thing that is found in 96% of the items we used regularly is the main cause of global warming. Deforestation is also another main cause of global warming. Trees play an important role in regulating the amount of carbon dioxide, a common greenhouse gas, present in the air. The Amazon rainforest is the most threatened forest in the world. The WWF estimates that 27% of the amazon biome would be without trees by 2030 due to deforestation.</span></p>\n<p class=\"align-left\"><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the biggest problems that are caused by global warming is the melting of glaciers. The world has seen an increase in sea levels due to this. The evidence for this is everywhere. For example, the Glacier National Park in Montana had 150 glaciers in 1910 but now the number has decreased to 30. If we let the glaciers melt at the rate they are right now, the consequences would be devastating. It is estimated that if all the glaciers in the world melt, the sea level would rise by 70 meters or higher. The melting of glaciers poses a great threat to all the coastal cities like New York, Tokyo, Shanghai, Los Angeles etc. Another problem caused by global warming is the decrease of ozone levels in the atmosphere. The ozone layer protects us from the harmful UV rays from the sun. Ozone depletion would result in variou skin related diseases and also cancer. </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><em><strong>Why do some people not believe in global warming?</strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">But of course, there are still a lot of people who do not believe in global warming despite having seen the evidence presented by scientists around the world. So why do some people not believe in global warming? I think that it boils down to people vs. science. People have been denying science for centuries, religion being one of the main reasons. Flat-Earthers, anti-vaxxers, anti-NASA etc. are all products of people vs. science. Another reason why people do not believe in global warming is that they simply can't feel the temperature increase for themselves as global warming is not an immediate change. It is a change that occurs and is occurring over a long period of time. People have to understand that these claims are being made by professional scientists who have spent most of their lives studying about the environment. They have to put more trust into these people than they do in conspiracy theories. Countries should start converting to renewable sources of energy. Practicing the 3 R’s (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) also helps to battle climate change.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citations</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">MacMillan , Amanda. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Warming 101</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 2016, </span><a href=\"http://www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101#warming\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.nrdc.org/stories/global-warming-101#warming</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Importance of Fossil Fuels.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">International Association of Geophysical Contractors | Houston, TX, 77008</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.iagc.org/importance-of-fossil-fuels.html#:~:text=Fossil%20fuels%20are%20found%20in,gas%20used%20to%20generate%20electricity\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.iagc.org/importance-of-fossil-fuels.html#:~:text=Fossil%20fuels%20are%20found%20in,gas%20used%20to%20generate%20electricity</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Glick, Daniel. </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Global Climate Change, Melting Glaciers</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 18 Jan. 2017, </span><a href=\"http://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/#:~:text=When%20temperatures%20rise%20and%20ice,warms%20and%20expands%20in%20volume\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/big-thaw/#:~:text=When%20temperatures%20rise%20and%20ice,warms%20and%20expands%20in%20volume</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Will the World Ever Be All under Water?: AMNH.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">American Museum of Natural History</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/explore/ology/earth/ask-a-scientist-about-our-environment/will-the-world-ever-be-all-under-water#:~:text=If%20all%20the%20ice%20covering,such%20as%20Denver%2C%20would%20survive.\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.amnh.org/explore/ology/earth/ask-a-scientist-about-our-environment/will-the-world-ever-be-all-under-water#:~:text=If%20all%20the%20ice%20covering,such%20as%20Denver%2C%20would%20survive.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Deforestation in the Amazon.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WWF</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><a href=\"https://wwf.panda.org/our_work/our_focus/forests_practice/deforestation_fronts2/deforestation_in_the_amazon/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">wwf.panda.org/our_work/our_focus/forests_practice/deforestation_fronts2/deforestation_in_the_amazon/#:~:text=Amazon%20is%20the%20biggest%20deforestation,current%20rate%20of%20deforestation%20continues.</span></a></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Butler, Rhett A. “Amazon Destruction.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mongabay</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Mongabay, 4 Feb. 2020, </span><a href=\"https://rainforests.mongabay.com/amazon/amazon_destruction.html\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rainforests.mongabay.com/amazon/amazon_destruction.html.</span></a></p>",

            "content_html": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to Psycom, a resource for mental health, nearly 20% of men and women in the US are chronic procrastinators, and that procrastination is an issue humanity has faced for centuries. It is the last thing that we want to do, but somehow it ends up happening anyways. From a young age, we are taught to manage our time properly in order to complete all of our responsibilities on time, but people can’t control when they procrastinate. We rely on self control and motivation to get tasks done, but it's when those two things aren’t present that procrastination occurs. It is a vicious cycle that is difficult to escape, but the first step in doing so is figuring out the reason behind your procrastination. </span></p>\n<p class=\"align-center msg msg--highlight \"><em><strong>Lack of motivation </strong></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>is one possible reason someone may procrastinate.</em> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As I stated before, motivation is what drives us to complete a task, so lack thereof would lead to the task not being completed. The cause behind lack of motivation is extrinsic motivation, meaning coming from an outside source. This is common among students in the form of teachers and parents. If the student themself does not want to complete their work, the motivation for them would come from their parents and teachers, which is not enough for them to complete their task.</span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><em><strong>Fear of failure and perfectionism </strong></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>is another cause to procrastination.</em> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These examples go hand in hand since they are very similar in their root cause, which is a person’s work not being good enough. If someone is afraid of failing, then they will not be driven to complete their work since they don’t want it to be seen as mediocre. Similarly, if someone is a perfectionist, then they will want their work to be flawless. This will either cause the person to never start their task, or to never finish it, since it has to be perfect. </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><em><strong>Negative emotions</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> are a large cause of procrastination, such as being overwhelmed or anxious about a task. </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One becomes overwhelmed by a task when they think it is much too large, or when multiple smaller tasks pile up. This will cause a person to avoid their tasks and procrastinate them. Anxiety about a task is difficult to overcome because it creates a loop. Once a person becomes anxious about a task, they will avoid it, which will only amplify their anxiety about it, since it is not being completed. </span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight  align-center\"><em><strong>Optimism</strong></em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>, however strange it sounds, contributes to procrastination as well.</em> </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Positive thinking, in terms of procrastination, refers to either the amount of time someone thinks a task will take, or one’s ability to complete it. This will lead them to believe that they won’t need to put much work into the task, which means they will wait to complete it. Because of this, when they actually do the task, it will become stressful when they realize they have not allowed themself enough time to do it well.</span></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight align-center\"><em><strong>Disconnect from the future self</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, or temporal disjunction, is another cause of procrastination, and also happens to be mine. </span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is when one sees their future self as a completely different person. This leads them to think that the task they have at hand is not their problem, but one for their future self to take care of. It becomes a way for them to deflect their responsibilities onto “someone else” and not worry about completing them. Speaking from personal experience, this ends up being a large problem when the due date for a task comes around and there is little to no work shown for it.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These are just a few of many causes of procrastination, and once you have identified why you procrastinate, you can then figure out how to stop. Here are some tips to help you get started:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Just start working. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The hardest part of any task is getting started, and once you get that out of the way, you have a good foundation for quality work.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Break it down. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The larger a task is, the less you will want to do it. Breaking a larger task into smaller ones will be a big help in staying productive.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Put aside possible distractions. </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find yourself a quiet workspace where you can focus on your task. It’s not possible to eliminate every single distraction there may be, but putting away the ones you know will cause a problem will allow you to concentrate.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Stay positive!</strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> If you approach a task with a negative attitude, your work will not be at its best, and it will be harder for you to focus. If you stay positive while working, it will be much more enjoyable and the quality of your work will be better.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Procrastination is one of the biggest obstacles preventing us from reaching our full potential. Don’t let yourself be the one to stop you from making the world a better place.</span></p>",

The situation only gets worse every day. According to UNICEF, more than half of those in need of humanitarian aid are children and around 2 million children under the age of 5 are malnourished. Civilians are suffering the most due to the lack of essential items. Roads and buildings required for delivering food and water have been destroyed or taken over resulting in the price of food skyrocketing. Most cannot afford enough food for their families and have had to flee their homes to get away from conflict. Houthi rebels who are fighting the government have been accused of confiscating food, water, and other essential items from civilians.</span></p>\n<p><em><strong>American involvement in Yemen: </strong></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ever since the start of the war, the United States supported its ally Saudi Arabia who is fighting against Yemeni forces. The U.S has sold over 110 billion in arms to Saudi since 2009. Many have been critical of America’s involvement and claim that the conflict will end if the U.S. pulls out. However, the U.S. continues to show support of Saudi and sells arms to them. Saudi forces use weapons without consideration of civilian lives which the U.S. knows but does nothing. Saudi Arabia targets Yemeni infrastructure as a strategy to cripple Yemen from the inside by causing civil unrest and to weaken enemy forces but the conflict has been stretched for years and thousands of civilian lives have been taken. </span></p>\n<p><strong><i>Covid-19 in Yemen:</i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The coronavirus has made things much worse than it already is in Yemen. Cases are spiking and most don’t have access to affordable healthcare which is crucial to stopping the spread of the virus. Most health workers are not receiving pay and basic sanitation supplies which is putting them at risk of getting the virus. They also get threatened and killed for doing their work causing many to flee in fear. Over 4 million people have been displaced and many of them live in areas with a high population density which further increases the danger of the situation. Many children could not afford school before the virus but now that schools have closed, 7.8 million children do not have access to education. There is a short supply of ventilators and test kits. Many are not aware of the dangers of the virus and its high contagiousness. The situation is getting worse every day and the UN has gone as far as airlifting testing kits to Yemen in hopes of slowing the spread.</span></p>\n<p><strong><i>How you can help: </i></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the best ways you can help other than donating is to spread awareness about the issue. Not many people know about this and it doesn’t get much media attention even though millions of people are starving. Spreading awareness about this issue will allow it get more media attention and garner more donors. Another way to help is to sign petitions that demand change. For example, a petition on Change.org already has over 2.7 million signatures. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some useful links to help :</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<div class=\"js-petition-content\">\n<div class=\"sm-txt-c mtxxl xs-mtm xs-phs\">\n<p class=\"mtl mbxxxl xs-mts xs-mbxs type-break-word petition-title\"><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y2olzqqk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stop the war and end the famine in Yemen, Change.org</a></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/yxotc3sg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Send support to fight medical crisis in Yemin, Islamic Relief USA</a></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y2p9ckpj\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Help save children in Yemen, savethechildren.org</a></li>\n<li class=\"align-left\" style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/y3d2gte3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Donate to help save Yemeni lives, Doctors Without Borders</a></li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em>Citations</em></p>\n<p>“What's Happening in Yemen? .” <i>BBC News</i>, BBC, 28 Mar. 2918, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/38317367\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/38317367</a>.</p>\n<p>UNICEF. “Yemen Crisis.” <i>UNICEF</i>, 22 July 2020, <a href=\"http://www.unicef.org/emergencies/yemen-crisis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">www.unicef.org/emergencies/yemen-crisis</a>.</p>\n<p>Bazzi, Mohamad. “America Is Likely Complicit in War Crimes in Yemen.

However, society tends to split women between being smart and beautiful.</em></strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are women who are seen as beautiful, and there are women who are smart, although in the past a lot less was seen of the latter. Take Hedy Lamarr. It is a name that evokes old Hollywood and great beauty. She was the most beautiful woman and a famous actress. She was also an inventor. Somehow, history tends to forget this last part.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lamarr had from a young age had had a love of science, which had been influenced by her father. He talked to her about the inner workings of machines to the point that Lamarr at the age of 5 was able to take apart and reassemble a music box. Guided by her mother, Lamarr took on roles in movies and eventually married a munitions manufacturer, who often had guests over. Lamarr would listen in on their conversations regarding wartimes weapons. In 1937, she left her unhappy marriage with a husband who didn’t see her beyond a pretty doll and eventually ended up in London. Unfortunately, this would not be her first experience with being seen only as pretty.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In London, she met the co-founder of MGM studios which eventually led to a career in Hollywood. Despite her newfound fame, Lamarr still found time for her inventive mind. In her trailer, she continued working on various projects. Howard Hughes encouraged her inventive mind, and would take her to airplane factories. She even designed airplane wings by taking inspiration from nature. She combined the design of the fastest fish’s fins and the fastest birds’ wings into one set of speedy airplane wings. “Genius” Hughes called her.  Her inventive side, though, was somewhat hidden from the public, and not because she didn’t want people to know.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lamarr shared her passion of inventing with George Antheil, a pianist. Both were concerned by the looming war and wanted to contribute ideas to help. In order to help torpedoes resist interference from the enemy, they created a frequency-hopping system that prevented the signal from being jammed. The transmitter and receiver would jump frequencies together and the enemy would not be able to intercept the message with the signal constantly moving across frequencies. In August 1942, they received a patent and donated it to the US Navy. However, the US Navy rejected it, saying it was too cumbersome. Unfazed, Lamarr continued to show her support for the war and used her celebrity status to raise money for war bonds. She even became a US citizen in 1953.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When Hedy Lamarr starred in a new movie, there were headlines raving about how beautiful she was and how greatly she performed. Her new invention? No big headline. Nothing. It is interesting to see what parts of her that society valued. Her beauty, definitely. Her acting, yes. Her scientific side? Nope. It was brushed aside. Why must society pick and choose which parts of people, especially women, to present to the world? Even today actresses are asked about what they wear or their makeup routine. Anything else is irrelevant.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the mid 1950s, the Navy did use her and Antheil’s concept on a buoy that was able to detect submarines and even used it during the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962. With the patent expiring in 1958, neither Lamarr or Antheil ever received any money from their invention.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As for Lamarr herself, she continued working as an actress until 1958, and even worked as a producer in 2 films. While her great beauty was praised by many, Lamarr did not find her outward appearance as the most important thing. “Any girl can look glamorous. All you have to do is look stupid,” she once said. Lamarr was aware of how society valued her beauty. In the 40s, her profile was most requested by plastic surgery patients. Could the same awe be said of her science side? No. Lamarr was in a way forced to hide that aspect about her because she couldn’t be recognized for being smart. Society only really valued beauty in women anyway. Even if she was smart, that wasn’t really important. It is unfortunate that society was, and still is, like that. Society should realize that beauty isn’t always about looking good. It is also about creativeness, kindness, what we can do for others, and so much more beyond physical attributes. Hedy Lamarr created the frequency-hopping system not for herself, but to help our country win the war.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As the years went on, Lamarr never really spoke of her inventive nature. Why? Perhaps because she felt she wouldn’t have been taken seriously. After all, the reason she left her first husband was because he never treated her like an equal. It is unfortunate that she felt that she had to conform to society’s ideals and couldn’t share her inventive side. Society’s idea of her was that she was pretty and that was it. Even today women have to deal with society only thinking of them as being pretty or smart, never both. To the public, Hedy Lamarr was only beautiful, and some probably thought that because she was beautiful, she was dumb as well. If she was smart, she would’ve been ugly. Which is completely untrue.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As time went on, society’s ideas of women lessened a bit. Women could get recognition for their brains even while being pretty. Long lost tapes from the 1990s tapes reveal a different side to Lamarr than the public had originally seen. She talked about her inventions, and said “The brains of people are more interesting than looks, I think.” She was beginning to be comfortable talking about her science side and know that she wouldn’t get ridiculed for it. Finally, in 1997, she began to receive credit for the work she had done. She was the first woman to receive the Invention Convention’s Bulbie Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award, which is the equivalent of an Oscar in the inventing world. The Electronic Frontier Foundation honored her and Antheil with the Pioneer Award. It took 50 years for her and Anthiel’s achievement to be recognized. Why did it have to take so long? Did society simply not want to recognize her efforts? We have to realize that people are more than just what they look like. The things they do, how they treat others are more important factors that define a person. Physical characteristics mean nothing and do not contribute to who a person is overall.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Lamarr passed away in 2000. However, her frequency-hopping system continues to live on. In fact, you most certainly have used it before, maybe even right now. Today, this technology is used in WiFi and Bluetooth communications. In 2014, she and Antheil were posthumously inducted into the Inventor’s Hall of Fame for their work.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is interesting how history has chosen what pieces of someone to remember. For Hedy Lamarr, history chose her beauty. Not her work as an inventor, which was ignored for years. It wasn’t until 50 years later after the invention of her and Antheil’s frequency-hopping system were they recognized for their work. Why was it forgotten? Perhaps because society values physical beauty more than anything else, especially concerning women. A woman cannot be both smart and pretty. But Hedy Lamarr defies that role. She was a brilliant inventor and a genius who also happened to look good. Her inventive mind is perhaps the most beautiful part about her.</span></p>\n<hr>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Citations</span></em></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brancaccio, David, and Paulina Velasco. “The Story of Hedy Lamarr, the Hollywood Beauty Whose Invention Helped Enable Wi-Fi, GPS and Bluetooth.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marketplace</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 29 Apr. 2019, </span><a href=\"http://www.marketplace.org/2017/11/21/inventor-changed-our-world-and-also-happened-be-famous-hollywood-star/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.marketplace.org/2017/11/21/inventor-changed-our-world-and-also-happened-be-famous-hollywood-star/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cheslak, Colleen. “Hedy Lamarr.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hedy Lamarr</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, National Women's History Museum, 30 Aug. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.womenshistory.org/students-and-educators/biographies/hedy-lamarr\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.womenshistory.org/students-and-educators/biographies/hedy-lamarr</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Desta, Yohana. “How Inventive ‘Genius’ Hedy Lamarr Became a Hollywood Tragedy.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Vanity Fair</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Vanity Fair, 25 May 2017, </span><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/hedy-lamarr-documentary-clip\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/hedy-lamarr-documentary-clip</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Field, Shivaune. “Hedy Lamarr: The Incredible Mind Behind Secure WiFi, GPS And Bluetooth.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Forbes</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Forbes Magazine, 8 Mar. 2018, </span><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/shivaunefield/2018/02/28/hedy-lamarr-the-incredible-mind-behind-secure-wi-fi-gps-bluetooth/#66f66fba41b7\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">www.forbes.com/sites/shivaunefield/2018/02/28/hedy-lamarr-the-incredible-mind-behind-secure-wi-fi-gps-bluetooth/#66f66fba41b7</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">George, Alice. “Thank This World War II-Era Film Star for Your Wi-Fi.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Smithsonian.com</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, Smithsonian Institution, 4 Apr. 2019, <a href=\"http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/thank-world-war-ii-era-film-star-your-wi-fi-180971584/\">www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/thank-world-war-ii-era-film-star-your-wi-fi-180971584/</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Long, Emily. “HEDY LAMARR, MARCH 2017 LAMP LUMINARY.” </span><i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Lamp</span></i><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, 14 </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mar. 2017, <a href=\"http://www.thelamp.org/hedy-lamarr/\">www.thelamp.org/hedy-lamarr/</a>.</span></p>",
